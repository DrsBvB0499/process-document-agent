Summary of Invoice Processing Workflow
========================================

Current State (AS-IS):
- Process Owner: Rachel Chen (Finance Manager)
- Volume: 500-800 invoices per day
- SLA: Process within 5 business days of receipt
- Systems: SAP (core ERP), SharePoint (document storage), Outlook (email)

Process Steps:
1. Invoice arrives via email to invoicing@company.com
2. Finance clerk logs invoice into SAP within same day
3. Amount validation: <$1000 approved by team lead, <$50k by manager, >$50k by CFO
4. Duplicate check performed manually against PDF archive
5. GL coding assigned based on business unit
6. Payment processed by accounting team in SAP

Known Exceptions:
- Recurring invoices from vendors (e.g., utilities) sometimes auto-approved
- Invoices in foreign currency handled by Treasury team
- Intercompany invoices follow different approval path
- Invoices exceeding payment terms delay approval for negotiation

Baseline Metrics (Last 30 days):
- Average processing time: 8 days (target: 5 days)
- Error rate: 12% (mostly duplicate detections, GL coding issues)
- Manual rework: 18% of invoices flagged for corrections
- System downtime: 2% (SAP maintenance windows)

Pain Points Identified:
- No visibility into approval queue
- Duplicate detection relies on manual PDF comparison
- Foreign currency exchange rate delays
- GL coding errors create month-end reconciliation work
- No audit trail for rejected invoices

Opportunities for Improvement:
- Automate duplicate detection using invoice number + vendor + amount matching
- Implement OCR for invoice data extraction
- Create company-wide vendor master data
- Establish approval workflow rules in SAP based on amount + business unit
